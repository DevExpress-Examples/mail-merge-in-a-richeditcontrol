# How to implement mail merge in a RichEditControl


<p>This example illustrates how to implement mail merge in the <strong>RichEditControl</strong>.<br /> Please refer to this help topic for more information: <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/9330/controls-and-libraries/rich-text-editor/mail-merge"><u>Mail Merge</u></a>.

In this example, the <strong>ArrayList</strong> that is generated at runtime is used as a data source that supplies mail merge data to the document. The tab control on the form contains a <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument9551"><u>Ribbon UI</u></a> and two <strong>RichEditControl</strong> instances (one of them is used to construct a document template, and the other displays the mail merge result).</p>
